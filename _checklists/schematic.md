  - title: Good schematic checklist
    list:
      - name: Refer to the correct datasheet version number and the last updated date for the component
      - name: Separate double wire junctions
      - name: Use dots for wire junctions, not crosses
      - name: Make symbols for similar devices consistent E.g. resistors
      - name: Name every part with a unique designator
      - name: Align wires and components horizontally or vertically
      - name: Label pin numbers on the outside of a symbol, signal names on the inside
      - name: Place text orientation consistently E.g. horizontal
      - name: Place components from left to right with a logical flow
      - name: Put higher voltage towards the top
      - name: Put positive voltages <code>Vcc</code> up and negative voltages <code>GND</code> down
      - name: Separate schematic into logical blocks
      - name: Make the schematic fit in <code>A4</code> or </code>A3</code> standard sized papers
      - name: Place decoupling capacitors next to their devices
      - name: Keep names reasonably short
      - name: Use uppercase symbol names
