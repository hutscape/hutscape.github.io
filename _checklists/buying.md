# Buying

> Before buying a breakout board, component, etc.

## Chips

- [ ] What protocols does it support? `I2C`, `SPI`, etc
- [ ] What firmware can it run?
- [ ] If it is a breakout board, can the single components be bought for future use?
- [ ] Type of packages available
- [ ] Example projects
- [ ] Mechanical dimensions
- [ ] Pitch size
- [ ] Number of pins
- [ ] Manufacturer part number
- [ ] Link to datasheet
- [ ] Are the firmware tools supported on macOSX?

## MCU

- [ ] GPIO
- [ ] Pin protocols
- [ ] Power modes E.g. active, standby, deep sleep
- [ ] Power consumption
- [ ] Manufacturer
- [ ] Manufacturer part number
- [ ] Memory and RAM
- [ ] Resolution
- [ ] Package type
- [ ] Link to datasheet
- [ ] Example projects
- [ ] Mechanical dimensions

## Modules / breakout boards

- [ ] Firmware
- [ ] Pinouts
- [ ] Main components
- [ ] Main component parts can be traced individually for future use
- [ ] Open schematic

## Online site

- Ensure minimum quantity matches
- Ensure part is not "No Longer Manufactured"
- Ensure part is not "No Longer Stocked"
- Ensure the part is available
- Ensure RoHS Compliant
- Ensure package type E.g. SMD
- Ensure package size is selected E.g. `0805`
- Ensure number of pins are correct
- Ensure manufacturer part is correct
